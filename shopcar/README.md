# ShopCar

> ShopCar(?) is MERN stack application that helps users looking to purchase or lease a car. The end user will have access to relevant information beyond the typical AutoTrader/CarMax website, such as detailed car specifications (driveline/horsepower/aftermarket warranty quotes/etc.). This information will be made available using the car databases and vehicle APIs that are currently available online. By creating a login (accomplished via Passport JS), the user will also have the ability to "save" a car and save options, allowing them to keep a shortlist of which cars they want to buy. 
> The purpose of ShopCar is to improve upon current car buying websites by offering more than just a vehicle's price and location, such as the ability to choose specific vehicle configurations and view detailed car specs, as well as the ability to save these vehicle/option combinations for future reference.
