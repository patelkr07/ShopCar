# ShopCar

> ShopCar(?) is MERN stack application that helps users looking to purchase or lease a car. The end user will have access to relevant information beyond the typical AutoTrader/CarMax website, such as detailed car specifications (driveline/horsepower/aftermarket warranty quotes/etc.) using available APIs and car databases. By creating a login (accomplished via Passport JS), they will also have the ability to "save" a car and save options, allowing them to keep a shortlist of which cars they want to buy -- this will be possible via the MERN stack.
